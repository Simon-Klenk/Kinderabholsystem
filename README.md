# Kids-Team Message Delivery System

This project addresses the need for efficient message delivery to parents during church services, specifically when the Kids-Team needs to contact parents who are present in the congregation but lack readily available contact information. The current process is time-consuming and disruptive.

**Solution:**

The system consists of a web interface for the Kids-Team to input messages and a hardware approval unit for the AV team.
